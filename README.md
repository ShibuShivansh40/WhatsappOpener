# WhatsappOpener

This repository is linked to a Write Up on Medium.

During the creation of this application, I ran through a problem : "Whatsapp Not Installed".

This was so because my Application was unbale to find the Package Named "Whatsapp" in the PackageManager. So, I was requiredd to insert the code:

"""<queries>
<package android:name="com.whatsapp" />
</queries>"""

in the manifest file. After adding the code, it started working quite well.
